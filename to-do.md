# To-Do

# User-Defineable API's
- Widget type for custom API
- Writes out a custom php file in the background to host the API. 
- Renders a note on the screen , or perhaps a collapseable iframe, with the api details.
- I imagine it'll hook requests and save them into a sqlite db, but could, in the end, just have a flat user-specified php script. Think more on this.

# todo / Events API / db

- pre-built API that can receive webhooks and stores the content and headers into fields in a row in a sqlite db. This way someone can quickly ping it, then query the events db for results. 

- Consider loading a small image from a site's root /favicon.ico above each bookmark for a more natural look, maybe this could be an optional feature.

# fix bug

- If no 'default' dashboard is found, load the first one. Ran into a bug when deploying updated code due to this and had to manually update DB.
- Have an interface somewhere where you can mark your default dashboard or set the current one as default. 


# Future Ideas

- Ability to query widget results, show a result list. 
- For scalar values, widget becomes a link that can take you to another page that displays the results in a table format. 
- API functionality for capturing requests into a custom sqlite db, then ability to display results on dashboard.
